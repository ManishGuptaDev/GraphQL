# Getting Started with TypeScript + Apollo Server

This project is created from scratch

## Apollo-Server

`apollo-server` is a fully-featured GraphQL server. It is based on Express.js and a few other libraries to help you build production-ready GraphQL servers. Here’s a list of some cool features it has:

1. GraphQL spec-compliant
2. Out-of-the-box support for two GraphQL clients: Apollo Explorer and GraphQL Playground
3. Can be configured for use with an Express server
4. Query performance tracing
5. Runs everywhere: Can be deployed via Vercel, Standard VMs, AWS Lambda, Heroku etc.

## Nexus

`Nexus` is a library to create type-safe GraphQL schemas with a code-first approach (since you write standard JavaScript/TypeScript code to define what your schema will look like, hence “code-first”). It has a number of great features:

1. Expressive, declarative API for building schemas
2. Full type-safety for free
3. Auto-generated GraphQL SDL (schema.graphql file)
4. Works out of the box with existing GraphQL frameworks and middleware (apollo-server, graphql-middleware, etc.)
